# Troubleshooting

Follow this guide step-by-step to troubleshoot your issue.

## Check your Discord settings first

Make sure "Share your detected activities with others"
is enabled in your Discord settings:

If that does not help, read on.

## Media players that don't work out of the box

These players require a plugin or helper program:

- **AIMP**
- **iTunes**
- **mpv**
- **MusicBee**
- **VLC**

If you have issues with any of these players,
please refer to the "Additional notes" in
[**this document**](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/blob/master/documentation/supported-media-players.md)
for instructions on which external plugins or helper programs are required
to get them to be detected by Music Presence.

Otherwise, continue reading the next section.

## The player is detected, but still no status

Can you see the media player detected in the tray menu?

And does the tray icon have this little triangle in the bottom right
while you are playing music?

If not, move on to the next section.

Otherwise try reinstalling Discord.
This happens rarely, but sometimes
Discord just refuses to show any presence until you reinstall it completely.

## If your media player is still not detected

First make sure you played some media with your media player
while Music Presence is running.

After that, navigate to the **Help** menu and click on

- **Submit detected media players**

This will open a new GitHub issue with information about all media players
that have been detected since you started Music Presence.
Submit the issue and I will come back to you as soon as I can.

You will need a GitHub account to submit the issue.
If you don't want to register one,
you can alternatively copy the link in the address bar,
join the [Discord server](https://discord-invite.musicpresence.app)
and then paste the copied link in the `#troubleshooting` channel.

## Reporting a different problem

If you have a different issue, please open a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/issues/new/choose)
or join the [Discord server](https://discord-invite.musicpresence.app).
